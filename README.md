# ECG Signal Classification Project

## Overview
This repository contains code for an ECG signal classification project using the MIT-BIH and PTB-XL datasets. The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models to classify ECG signals into different categories.

## Dataset
- **MIT-BIH Dataset**: [Link to dataset](insert_link_here)
- **PTB-XL Dataset**: [Link to dataset](insert_link_here)

## Repository Structure
- **Best Model**: This folder contains the training and evaluation code for the best performing model achieved in the project. All code files are in the form of Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files.
  - **Best_Model_Training.ipynb**: Notebook file for training the best model.
  - **Best_Model_Testing.ipynb**: Notebook file for testing the best model.
  
- **Research**: This folder contains research-related code and experiments.
  - **Preprocessing**: Code for preprocessing ECG signals.
  - **Baseline**: Code for baseline models.
  - **MPA**: Code for models based on Multi-Perspective Aggregation.
  - **Deep Learning**: Code for deep learning models.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:

2. Install the required dependencies:

## Usage
1. Navigate to the `Best Model` directory:

2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook files to train and evaluate the model.

## Results
- **Best Model Performance**: Insert performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) achieved by the best model.
